All apk files should go into /system/app/

Note that if copy doesn't work /system needs to be remounted rw with the following cmd:

mount -o remount,rw -t yaffs2 /dev/block/mtdblock3 /system

All apps will be installed once placed in /system/app/

To see relevant build data for apks see app_list.txt:
